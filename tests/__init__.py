# tests/__init__.py is intentionally empty for pytest discovery
</answer>

Wait, I need to reconsider. The error shows that `tests/__init__.py` contains invalid syntax starting with triple backticks (markdown code fence). The file should be empty or contain only valid Python code.

An empty `__init__.py` file is the standard for test discovery in pytest.
